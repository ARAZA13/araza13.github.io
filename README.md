## Work Experience
**Consulant Economist @ World Bank Group (_June 2022 - Present_)**

- The Data Depot on Education in Pakistan aims to provide a platform for proactive and open access to standardized micro-data relevant to education in Pakistan.
- The short-term objective is to provide policymakers and researchers with an easy-to-use interface to track key indicators on learning and school participation in Pakistan. This initiative hopes to crowd in more research on education in Pakistan, by putting together data on education in Pakistan in one place.
- The medium-term objective is to improve the use of data for decision-making on education in Pakistan.
- As a part of this initiative, indicator panels were calculated by selecting and cleaning "key variables" on education from multiple data source(s) i.e. ASER, HIES, PSLM, MICS, DHS, and EGRA. Each survey from these data sources was cleaned and the "key variables" were made consistent (i.e. harmonized) in terms of their scale both vertically (across years) and horizontally (across datasets) before aggregating the data to create 3 indicator panels at the following levels:

(A). Country-level,
(B). Province-level, and
(C). District-level.



**Project Manager @ CERP (_December 2020 - Present_)**
- Conducted data collection, processing, and analysis for novel study evaluating the impact of over 300 biometrics variables on human performance in hyper-realistic, live-fire training scenarios
- Applied unsupervised deep learning approaches to longitudinal ICU data to discover novel sepsis sub-phenotypes

Developed objective strategy for discovering optimal EEG bands based on signal power spectra using **Python**. This data-driven approach led to better characterization of the underlying power spectrum by identifying bands that outperformed the more commonly used band boundaries by a factor of two. The proposed method provides a fully automated and flexible approach to capturing key signal components and possibly discovering new indices of brain activity.
