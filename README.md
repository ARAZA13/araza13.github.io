## Project(s):
### Data Depot Pakistan - World Bank Group
[Publication](https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/search/dataset/0038010/Data-Depot---Pakistan)

- The Data Depot on Education in Pakistan aims to provide a platform for proactive and open access to standardized micro-data relevant to education in Pakistan.

- The short-term objective is to provide policymakers and researchers with an easy-to-use interface to track key indicators on learning and school participation in Pakistan. This initiative hopes to crowd in more research on education in Pakistan, by putting together data on education in Pakistan in one place.

- The medium-term objective is to improve the use of data for decision-making on education in Pakistan.

- As a part of this initiative, indicator panels were calculated by selecting and cleaning "key variables" on education from multiple data source(s) i.e. ASER, HIES, PSLM, MICS, DHS, and EGRA. Each survey from these data sources was cleaned and the "key variables" were made consistent (i.e. harmonized) in terms of their scale both vertically (across years) and horizontally (across datasets) before aggregating the data to create 3 indicator panels at the following levels:

(A). Country-level,
(B). Province-level, and
(C). District-level.
